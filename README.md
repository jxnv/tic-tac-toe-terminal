# tic-tac-toe-terminal

This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. It allows two players to play the classic game on the Linux terminal.

How to Play

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Clone this repository or download the tictactoe.py file.

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the tictactoe.py file is located.

Run the following command to start the game:

python3 tictactoe.py

The game will display the board and prompt Player 1 (X) to enter their move. Enter a number from 1 to 9 corresponding to the cell you want to mark.

The game will alternate between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O). Take turns entering valid moves until a player wins or the board is full.

If a player wins, the game will display the winning message. If the board is full and there is no winner, the game will end in a tie.

Play again by running the command python3 tictactoe.py.
